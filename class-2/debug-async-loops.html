<title>Debug: Async & Loops</title>
<h1></h1>
<p>
  Async functions defined in loops are called after the loop is finished.
  So if they use a value that changes on each iteration (such as
  <code>index</code> in <code>var index = 0; index < 2; index++</code>), those
  functions will be called with the last value of <code>index</code> (in this
  case <code>2</code>).
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Fix</summary>
  <p>
    Wrap the async part in a function and pass <code>index</code> to that as a
    parameter.
  </p>
</details>

var title = document.querySelector('h1');

/* This loop will first set the not-ok message, and a second later
 * show the ok message. Right? */
for (var index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    if (index === 1) {
      title.textContent = 'Fixed! 🎉';
      title.style.color = 'green';
    } else {
      title.textContent = '🔥🐶☕️ This is fine… 🔥';
      title.style.color = 'red';
    }
  }, index * 1000);
}

/* No. Yes, we set two functions with `setTimeout`. But they’ll be
 * called when the loop is finished. The loop is finished when
 * `index` is `2`, so we go into the `else` branch. */
