# Style

A simple responsive donut chart visualising the populations of various age
groups with pretty colours based on a [`bl.ock`][block]

I changed the structure to my liking

## Background

The assignment was to change the HTML/JS/CSS structure to my own style. For the HTML I always use "" voor linking files. 
I also closed the `<body>` tagg. For the CSS, it was pretty much how I always style my CSS. I always use one tab if a code line is
within another code line. The only real differences was using code colors. I always rely on using # codes. I also put the .arc, text 
on one line. I find that more easy to read. I also changed the font-family line. I usually use 3 fonts in total. the font size I changed
to em. This is mostly because of project Web. With the JS I mostly changed some variable/function names. I find it more easy to read
if I use the name in wich I associate the object with. The structure is mostly the same as the CSS one, so I really didn't change much.
