# Barchart!

I will explain in this short description what I must do.

## Background 

I did this assignment for Front end 3. I will learn how to use D3. I must explain how my code will work.

## Data

There are two data types I use:

* `Frequency` - this uses prencentages to determ how much it is.
* `Letters`   - I use it to display the precentages with the letters. Normaly it uses all the letters in the alphabet. I customized it.

## Features

*  [`d3-scale`] (https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)
*  [`d3-svg-axis`] (https://github.com/d3/d3-axis#api-reference)
