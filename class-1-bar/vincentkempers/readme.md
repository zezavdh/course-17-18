# Bar Chart about my daily steps

This is a bar chart I made with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and used data from my daily steps. I used this data obtained from my Apple Watch. I picked the bar chart from [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304).


## Description

This bar chart is een assignment for Communications and Multimedia Design Amsterdam (CMD). The assignment was to create a chart from data you obtained. The bar chart will be pushed on a forked repo to show

In this assignment you needed to do a couple of things to understand the code:

1. Comment the code (so you know what is happening).
2. Edit (as much as you can so you understand what is happening).
3. Try to break it (breaking is learning ðŸ¤”).
4. Give credit to the author.
5. Give your chart some style (as much as you can).
