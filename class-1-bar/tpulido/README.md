# Bar chart - phone percentage

This repo contains the code for the bar chart assignment. It uses the [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) to show the data in the chart.

## Background

I started with picking a chart from the [d3 gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). After this I copied the code and seperated the Html, Css and Javascript.
I inserted my own data in the tsv file and gave the document a title. Then I changed the style of the bars.


## Data

The chart displays the percentage of my phone at the end of the day. This shows how intensive I used my phone on different days.

On the bottom the different days are displayed, and on the left the percentages.
