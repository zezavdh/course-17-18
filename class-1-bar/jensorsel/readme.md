# Bar chart - Hours of sleep

![Preview image](preview.png)

A bar chart displaying the hours of sleep over week 39.

## Background

This chart was created as a part of the course 'Front-end development 3', which is part of the study programme "Communication and Multimedia Design".

The data used was collected as part of another course ("Data Visualisation"). 

## Data

The visualised data are the hours that I've slept in week 39 (25 Sep - 1 Oct). Every day lists the amount of hours that I've slept during the night *before that day*. For example, if Monday reads 8 hours, that means on the night of Sunday to Monday I slept 8 hours.

Each column (x-axis) represents a day, the columns' height represents the amount of hours (y-axis).
