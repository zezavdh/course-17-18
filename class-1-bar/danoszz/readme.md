# Stacked Bar Chart

This stacked bar chart was created for [Class 1: Bar chart](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/blob/master/class-1.md#bar-chart) using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

## Background

Following steps have been taken in creating a bar chart with D3.js. These steps can be followed to recreate the result and can be seen as ***instructions***.

1. Browse and find a [example code](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery#basic-charts). This visual uses [the stacked bar chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3886208)
2. Recreate files `index.html` and `data.csv` locally in a new directory.
3. Open your favorite terminal, type `cd`, drag and drop your directory (don't forget the extra space) and press `enter`.
4. Fired up a simple server with

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

5. Test the bar chart and clean up files by separating HTML, CSS, CSV and JS into `index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`, `index.csv`. Still got a working chart and no errors in your console? Nice you are good to go üçæ
6. Find external data source on example: the Dutch [CBS](http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37296ned&D1=8-13&D2=50-66&HDR=G1&STB=T&CHARTTYPE=2&VW=D) and download it.
7. Clean up CSV into a readable format for D3

8. Add some styling to the `index.css` and a small joke in `kek.js` (optional) the visualization is done! üöÄ

## Data
